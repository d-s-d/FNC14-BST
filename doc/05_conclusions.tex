\section{Conclusions}

We could demonstrate that with few relatively simple changes to the original
algorithm, one can significantly improve the performance of an implementation.
Since calculating tables by combining existing entries is inherent to dynamic
programming, it is likely that the observations we made can be translated to
other dynamic programming problems as well.

While in the case of the scalar implementations, very little is to gain by
further optimizing the code, as we are close to the computational bound, the
roofline-plots clearly indicate that in the case of vectorization, there is
room for refinement.
