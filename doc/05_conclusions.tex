\section{Conclusions}

We could demonstrate that with few relatively simple changes to the original
algorithm, one can significantly improve the performance of an implementation.
Since calculating tables by combining existing entries is inherent to dynamic
programming, it is likely that the observations we made can be translated to
other dynamic programming problems as well.

We were further able to structure the scalar implementations of the algorithm in
such a way, that the vectorization follows naturally.
